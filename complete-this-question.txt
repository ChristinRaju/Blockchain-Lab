Smart Subsidy Distribution System

The government introducted a ablackochain based smart contract to distribute agricultural subsidies fairly.

A farmer is eligible to receive the subsidy only if all the following conditions are satisfied:
- The farmer age is 21 years or above
- The farmer owns land
- The farmer is not makret as deafulter

Additionaly:
- if the farmer belongs to a priority category(e.g., small or marginal farmers),
- the subsidy should be approved even if land ownership is false,
- but only if the farmers is not a deafulter

Question

- Uses logical AND(&&), logical OR(||), AND LOGICAL not(!)
- determines whether the farmers is eligible for subsidy
- retuens true if eligible, otherwise false
